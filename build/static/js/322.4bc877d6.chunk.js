At the same time, modern threat hunting platforms based on pattern detection and behavior analysis rule the market. When detecting anomalies and attack patterns, our approach typically combines advanced analytics and machine learning tools while continuously monitoring system events and changes at the most minute levels. For instance, an attack can be recognized by a specific pattern of kernel function calls. No matter how "noisy" the actual log is, access to this data is necessary for a security solution to find the attack sequence. More system data we can gather will enable us to build a more efficient platform.
